A friend that owns a Jewelry came to me speaking that he spends a lot of money on a complex system that he and his employees barely used, so I suggested to him, to make a spreadsheet, and he agreed, so that's what I did. This is a copy of the spreadsheet that I changed the data, I made 2 spreadsheet tabs, one for each salesman, and a manager tab
