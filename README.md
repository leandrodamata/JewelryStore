# JewelryStore
A friend that owns a Jewelry came to me speaking that he spends a lot of money on a complex system that he and his employees barely used, so I suggested to him, to make a spreadsheet, and he agreed, so that's what I did.
This is a copy of the spreadsheet that I changed the data.
I made 2 spreadsheet tabs, one for each salesman, and a manager tab, wich includes basic graphics and a complete table with all the sales, of both salesmans.

In the Future I Will make and report with the data of this spreadsheet on Power BI also
